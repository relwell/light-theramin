# The Light Theramin

I mostly stole this from the leap-lifx project from dluxembourg.

Uses LIFX's Ruby API and an Express JS-based LEAP Motion integration
to allow you to alter the HSL of the lamp with your gestrues.

# Getting Started

With your LIFX connected to the same network as your machine,
and your LEAP motion connected:

    npm install  # this might fail, whatever
    npm start    # this runs a server
